Images

## Project

 * **Website**: <https://www.osbuild.org>
 * **Bug Tracker**: <https://github.com/osbuild/images/issues>
 * **IRC**: #osbuild on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/)
 * **Changelog**: <https://github.com/osbuild/images/releases>

### Principles
1. The image definitions API is internal and can therefore be broken. The blueprint API is the stable API.
2. Nonsensical manifests should not compile (at the Golang level).
3. OSBuild units (stages, sources, inputs, mounts, devices) should be directly mapped into Go objects.
4. Image definitions donâ€™t test distributions that are end-of-life. Respective code-paths should be dropped.
5. Image definitions need to support the oldest supported target distribution.

### Contributing
